# CSE423---Computer-Graphics
This Computer Graphics Project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of 2D and 3D visual elements using various rendering techniques. The project covers foundational concepts in computer graphics, including drawing algorithms, transformations, shading, and object modeling.

Key Features:
2D and 3D Rendering: Implements rasterization and ray tracing for real-time and realistic rendering.
Midpoint Circle Algorithm: Efficiently draws circles using integer calculations.
Transformation Techniques: Supports scaling, rotation, and translation of graphical objects.
Lighting and Shading: Adds realistic lighting effects using Phong and Gouraud shading models.
User Interaction: Allows user inputs to manipulate objects and camera views.
Cross-platform: Compatible with multiple operating systems.
Technologies Used:
OpenGL: For rendering graphics.
GLUT: For handling windowing and user inputs.
C++: Core programming language for logic and algorithms.
